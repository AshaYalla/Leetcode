<pre>+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the primary key of this table. 
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.  
</pre>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing <code>amount</code>&nbsp;for at least three consecutive days. Include the <code>customer_id</code>,&nbsp;start date of the consecutive transactions&nbsp;period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by</em> <code>customer_id</code> <em>in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</em></p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>
